Please rank each of the five textual descriptions below from least useful (1) to most useful (5). - In India and Bangladesh female mortality has decreased by a higher percentage (around 40%) when male mortality has only decreased by almost half that percentage (23%). On the other hand, in the United State female mortality has only decreased by 11% while male mortality has decreased by double that amount at 22%. China shows a significant decrease in mortality rate of 36% for males and 38% for females. The lowest mortality rate in 2015 for both males and females was in China.","Here are the five textual descriptions for Ranking Task (#1310). Please rank each of the five textual descriptions below from least useful (1) to most useful (5). - Every country's adult mortality rates for both males and for females have decreased over the course of 25 years from 1990 to 2015. For all countries except the USA, this is more marked among females than males. In the USA, this is the reverse, and the mortality rate among males has dropped at double the rate than among females. Of the countries shown, Rwanda's death rate was particularly high for both males and females, but has dropped considerably for both, putting its current mortality rate on a par with the other countries.","Here are the five textual descriptions for Ranking Task (#1310). Please rank each of the five textual descriptions below from least useful (1) to most useful (5). - The mortality rates decrease and the percentages are lower in countries such as the USA and China where they have fairly advanced healthcare. Bangladesh and India mortality rates are roughly the same even though their populations are vastly different. The percent decrease in male mortality rate is exactly the same in Bangladesh and India, even though India has far more people in their country. Overall, we can see that from 1990 to 2015 every country exhibits a decrease in the adult mortality rate. This decrease in mortality rate of both sexes might be explained by an increase in standard of living and development of medicine and technology.","Here are the five textual descriptions for Ranking Task (#1310).

Please rank each of the five textual descriptions below from least useful (1) to most useful (5). - The visual trend suggests that higher rates of gun ownership by household lead to more gun deaths. However, there are some exceptions to this trend, such as South Dakota, where 60% of households own guns, but there are only around 9 deaths per 100,000 people. Most states are clustered in the center of the x-axis (which plots gun ownership as percent of households) with an estimated 40% of households owning guns.","Here are the five textual descriptions for Ranking Task (#3130).

They are more likely to have poor working and living conditions and can develop related health problems.

And it would be better if the description provides some deeper analysis like aligning data developments with the background of different time periods.  The description would be almost useless if it only describes the encoding of the visualization because the reader wouldn't get any insight from these texts, which not only increases the readers' reading burden but also conveys no effective information about the data.","Yes, I think there is a considerable barrier to understand visualizations when I'm dealing with some large visual analysis systems, which often use very complex visual encodings and involve many ways of interaction. Although these systems may be easy to use and explore for some skilled data analysts, they can cause great confusion to ordinary users. Since it would usually take a long time to figure out where the analyzing flow should start and how the visualizations are coordinated. Even with well-organized multi-view visualization generated by analysts using these systems, it would still be hard for users to interpret.","This is a very interesting survey and I expect a lot from it. However, the real situation is a lot more complicated than the authors set in the survey. For example, the visualization may not be totally inaccessible, there may be just some limited number of dead pixels on the materials (newspaper, screen, and others), and some part of the visualization could still be seen. As for the textual description, there must be an appropriate length for that. Some of the descriptions in the survey are too long and contained too many details. Although the descriptions can be very thorough in this way, it really heavys the reading burden when the visualization is actually accessible, which is the most case for me.  Technically, I think it points to a bigger problem of using multiple media (visualization and natural language) to help people better understand the underlying data, especially when some parts of the visual or textual descriptions are inaccessible. Combining the advantages of both vision and language, it will guide the users to find out more about the data. I think there are a lot of opportunities for that."

I agree to participate in this study.,5,3,4,2,1,I have read and understood the Instructions and Example Ranking Question.,3,5,4,2,1,3,4,5,2,1,3,4,5,2,1,5,2,3,4,1,2,4,5,3,1,4,5,3,2,1,3,5,4,2,1,3,4,5,2,1,3,5,4,2,1,2,3,5,4,1,2,3,4,5,1,3,5,4,2,1,5,4,3,2,1,2,4,5,3,1,3,4,5,2,1,High school diploma,30 to 39,Male,software and web accessibility,5 to 10 years,VoiceOver,Multiple times a week,I encounter inaccessible visualizations in all of these contexts,Data reports for work,Agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,Somewhat agree,Presented both as a standalone description and presented in the main text of the article.,A textual description of a visualization is more useful when it provides a succinct and objective summary of the information. Descriptions become less useful when subjective opinions are included or when the description attempts to comprehend the data for the reader.,"The largest barriers that I experience with regard to lack of accessibility to data visualizations has to do with interpreting reports that can be generated to indicate library related tasks, e.g checkouts, holds, purchases, etc. Although these reports can be generated as spreadsheets, depending on comprehensiveness of the report, it often takes more work for a screen reader to interpret the data. ","The biggest barrier that I see with regard to accessible data visualization is the amount of work necessary to create a textual description without trying to interpret the data for the user. Until AI technologies are able to efficiently generate these types of descriptions, scalability will continue to remain a barrier to access."
