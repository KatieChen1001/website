CHI 2013 offers over 500 separate events including paper presentations, panels, courses, case studies and special interest groups. Given the size of the conference, it is no longer practical to host live summaries of these events. Instead, a 30-second <em>Video Preview</em> summary of each event is available. The CHI’13 Interactive Schedule helps attendees navigate this wealth of video content in order to identify events they would like to attend. It consists of a number of large display screens throughout the conference venue which cycle through a <em>video playlist</em> of events. Attendees can interact with these displays using their mobile devices by either constructing custom video playlists or adding on-screen content to their personal schedule.
