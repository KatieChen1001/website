If the transmission is controlled, there are fewer simultaneous cases. If the transmission is uncontrolled, the number of cases exceeds the capacity of the healthcare system. If the transmission is controlled, the healthcare system can support all the cases. In other words, the use of control measures allows the healthcare system to support all of the people who contract COVID-19 over time, although the epidemic may last longer as a result.","Here are the five textual descriptions for Ranking Task (#2230).

For all countries except the USA, this is more marked among females than males. In the USA, this is the reverse, and the mortality rate among males has dropped at double the rate than among females. Of the countries shown, Rwanda's death rate was particularly high for both males and females, but has dropped considerably for both, putting its current mortality rate on a par with the other countries.","Here are the five textual descriptions for Ranking Task (#1310).

Bangladesh and India mortality rates are roughly the same even though their populations are vastly different. The percent decrease in male mortality rate is exactly the same in Bangladesh and India, even though India has far more people in their country. Overall, we can see that from 1990 to 2015 every country exhibits a decrease in the adult mortality rate. This decrease in mortality rate of both sexes might be explained by an increase in standard of living and development of medicine and technology.","Here are the five textual descriptions for Ranking Task (#1310).

This may link to the possibility for the Richest people to access and afford a better and top quality health system. The Poorest people have the lowest percentage of C-sections, likely because they couldn't afford it, or because they were treated differently.
