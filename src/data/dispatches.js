    abstract: `The historical moment when a person worked in front of a single computer has passed. Computers
    are now ubiquitous and embedded in virtually every new device and system, ranging from the
    omnipresent cellphone to the complex web of sociotechnical systems that envelop most every
    sphere of personal and professional life. They connect our activities to ever-expanding
    information resources with previously unimaginable computational power. Yet with all the
    increases in capacity, speed, and connectivity, information-based activities too often remain
    difficult, awkward, and frustrating. Even after six decades of design evolution there is
    little of the naturalness and contextual sensitivity required for convivial interaction with
    computer-mediated information.
    
    We envision a future in which the existing world of documents and applications is linked to a
    multiscale personalized information space in which dynamic visual entities behave in
    accordance with cognitively motivated rules sensitive to tasks, personal and group interaction
    histories, and context. As a group of cognitive and computer scientists, we have come together
    jointly committed to this vision and convinced of the crucial importance of questioning the
    presupposition that information is fundamentally passive data disconnected from processes,
    tasks, context, and personal histories. We aim to redesignate the role that computers play in
    human life from devices with which we interact to partners with whom we collaborate.
   
    The heart of the project is to rethink the nature of computer-mediated information as a basis
    to begin to fully realize the potential of computers to assist information-based
    activities. This requires challenging fundamental presuppositions that have led to today’s
    walled gardens and information silos. Our goal is to catalyze an international research
    comunity to rethink the nature of information as a basis for radically advancing the
    human-centered design of information-based work and helping to ensure the future is one of
    convivial, effective, and humane systems. In this paper, we propose a new view of information,
    discuss cognitive requirements for a human-centered information space, and sketch a
    research agenda and approach.`,

    authors: ['navahaghighi', 'arvindsatya'],
    venue: 'tei-wip',
    year: 2020,
    abstract: 'Self-Interfaces are interfaces that intuitively communicate relevant subconscious physiological signals through biofeedback to give the user insight into their behavior and assist them in creating behavior change. The human heartbeat is a good example of an intuitive and relevant haptic biofeedback; does not distract and is only felt when the heart beats fast. In this work, we discuss the design and development of a wearable haptic Self-Interface for Electrodermal Activity (EDA). EDA is a covert physiological signal correlated with high and low arousal affective states. We will evaluate the effectiveness of the EDA Self-Interface based on its intuitiveness, its ability to generate useful insight, whether this insight leads to behavior change, and whether the user can develop an intuitive awareness of their EDA over time when the device is removed. We hope the findings from this study will help us establish a series of guidelines for development of other Self-Interfaces in the future.',

    year: 2019,
    abstract: 'Visualization researchers have begun exploring real-time visualization synchronization, but the focus has been on the technology supporting such synchronizations, and very little research looks at the front-end. In this paper, we present Visualive, an exploration of the representation of real-time users in the space of a visualization. Visualive represents online users by embedding dynamic color-coded widgets within a visualization, allowing viewers to easily identify remote actions being performed without leaving the context of a visualization. Visualive is an initial dive into merging collaboration and synchronization with data visualization without compromising on the latter experience.',
    teaser: 'The Visualive synchronized visualization system. Left: several users are interacting simultaneously with the view, with the current user following another user as they brush and zoom into the visualization. Right: the viewing user has hovered over a remote user’s bubble, resulting in the appearance of the purple tracking window that represents the remote user’s screen area.',

    abstract: 'CHI 2013 offers over 500 separate events including paper presentations, panels, courses, case studies and special interest groups. Given the size of the conference, it is no longer practical to host live summaries of these events. Instead, a 30-second <em>Video Preview</em> summary of each event is available. The CHI’13 Interactive Schedule helps attendees navigate this wealth of video content in order to identify events they would like to attend. It consists of a number of large display screens throughout the conference venue which cycle through a <em>video playlist</em> of events. Attendees can interact with these displays using their mobile devices by either constructing custom video playlists or adding on-screen content to their personal schedule.',

    abstract: 'Researchers have long envisioned a Semantic Web, where unstructured Web content is replaced by documents with rich semantic annotations. Unfortunately, this vision has been hampered by the difficulty of acquiring semantic metadata for Web pages. This paper introduces a method for automatically “semantifying” structural page elements: using machine learning to train classifiers that can be applied in a post-hoc fashion. We focus on one popular class of semantic identifiers: those concerned with the <em>structure</em> — or information architecture — of a page. To determine the set of structural semantics to learn and to collect training data for the learning, we gather a large corpus of labeled page elements from a set of online workers. We discuss the results from this collection and demonstrate that our classifiers learn structural semantics in a general way.',

    abstract: 'The Web is an enormous and diverse repository of design examples. Although people often draw from extant designs to create new ones, existing Web design tools do not facilitate example reuse in a way that captures the scale and diversity of the Web. To do so requires using machine learning techniques to train computational models which can be queried during the design process. In this work-in-progress, we present a platform necessary for doing such large-scale machine learning on Web designs, which consists of a Web crawler and proxy server to harvest and store a lossless and immutable snapshot of the Web; a page segmenter that codifies a page’s visual layout; and an interface for augmenting the segmentations with crowdsourced metadata.',
